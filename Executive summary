# üìä Profitability Diagnostic Dashboard ‚Äì Superstore Product Analysis (2014‚Äì2018)

This project analyzes the **Sample Superstore dataset** to uncover where a retail business may be **losing profits**, and helps answer critical questions like:

- Which product categories consistently underperform?
- Which regions or customer segments are draining profit margins?
- How do costs and discounts affect overall profitability?
- Where is strategic business intervention most needed?

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The data for 2018 only includes transactions from the first 5 days of the year. Custom DAX formulas were used to ensure year-by-year comparisons remain accurate.

## ‚úÖ Key Insights from the Dashboard

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Which Products or Sub-Categories Consistently Underperform?

The **bottom 3 loss-making subcategories** from 2014 to 2018 were:

- **Tables**
- **Bookcases**
- **Supplies**

These categories posted **negative profits every year**, with **Tables** being the worst performer. Even when total revenue increased, these subcategories continued to drag down profitability ‚Äî likely due to:

- High cost of goods
- Excessive discounting
- Low or stagnant sales volume

**Action**: Evaluate whether to reprice, redesign, or discontinue these subcategories.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Which Regions or Customer Segments Are Draining Margins?

- The **East** and **Central** regions had the **highest cumulative losses** on the worst-performing products.
- The **West** region was the most consistent in generating positive profits, especially in categories like **Phones** and **Copiers**.

**Action**: Audit operational costs, logistics, and sales practices in underperforming regions. Apply successful strategies from the West to other regions.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ How Do Costs and Discounts Impact Overall Profitability?

- Deep discounts were heavily applied to loss-making categories.
- In some years, **costs outpaced revenue growth**, leading to shrinking profit margins.
- Analysis of the **cost-to-profit relationship** showed that the business was becoming less efficient over time.

**Action**: Limit discounts in categories already showing loss trends. Introduce cost audits and improve pricing strategy.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Which Operations Need Strategic Intervention?

Problem areas that require attention:

- **Pricing strategies** for Tables and Bookcases
- **Inefficient branch performance** in the East and Central regions
- **Lack of bundling strategy** for underperforming Supplies products

**Action**: Set performance KPIs by region, implement pricing reviews, and explore bundling underperforming products with bestsellers.

---

## üéØ Project Goals and Deliverables

### üÖ∞Ô∏è Track Profit Leaks Across Product Lines, Categories, and Regions
- Custom DAX measures isolate **total loss per category**.
- Time-series visuals show **when and where** losses occurred.
- Filters and slicers allow real-time interaction with specific categories or years.

### üÖ±Ô∏è Identify Loss-Making Products and Inefficient Branches
- The dashboard ranks subcategories by **cumulative loss**.
- A regional breakdown highlights **inefficiencies at the branch level**.

### üÖ≤ Visualize Real-Time Profit Margins and Cost Breakdown
- Included measures for:
  - `Total Profit`
  - `Total Cost`
  - `Profit Margin %`
- Yearly breakdowns built with DAX using:
  ```dax
  total cost (2018) = 
  CALCULATE(
      [total cost],
      FILTER(
          'clean_superstore',
          YEAR([Ship Date]) = 2018
      )
  )
