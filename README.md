Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Definition:
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) represents the direct costs associated with producing or purchasing the products that a company sells during a specific period. It includes expenses like manufacturing costs, wholesale purchase price, and other direct costs but excludes indirect expenses such as marketing or distribution.

Why It Matters
Tracking COGS is essential because it tells the business how much it costs to earn revenue. When subtracted from total sales, it reveals the gross profit. High COGS can mean reduced margins and potential profitability issues.

How Itâ€™s Calculated in This Project
In the original dataset, only Sales and Profit were provided.
To estimate COGS, we use the relationship:

COGS = Sales - Profit

This gives a good approximation of product-level cost, since:
Sales = The amount paid by the customer
Profit = The net amount earned after subtracting costs
Therefore, the remaining portion (Sales - Profit) represents the cost incurred in selling that item
